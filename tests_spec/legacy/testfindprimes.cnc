// Declarations
// The tag values are the odd numbers in the range [3..n]
<int oddNums>;
// The prime numbers as identified by the compute step
[int primes <int>];

// Step prescription
// For each oddNums instance, there is 
<oddNums> ::  (compute);

// Step execution
// The compute step may produce a prime number (in the form of a item instance)
(compute) -> [primes]; 

// Input from the environment: initialize all tags
env -> <oddNums>; 

// Output to the environment is the collection of the prime numbers
[primes] -> env;
