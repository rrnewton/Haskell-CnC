Things to work on:

  * reorganize schedulers into separate modules

  * Finish GMAP implementation and test it.  Make it parameterize on
    key & value type and try Judy arrays.

  * put tail_putt into use and finish it for all schedulers

  * redo scheduler #8 with continuation monad (e.g. scheduler 9)

  * Fix scheduler 6 resulting in sched 7 which can either "heal" lost
    workers periodically, or which is non-quiescent but which has all
    workers spin (maybe with some sleeping) until the finalize action
    is finished.
