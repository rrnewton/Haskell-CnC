Things to work on:

  * reorganize schedulers into separate modules

  * Finish GMAP implementation and test it.  Make it parameterize on
    key & value type and try Judy arrays.

  * put tail_putt into use and finish it for all schedulers

  * redo scheduler #8 with continuation monad (e.g. scheduler 9)

  * Fix scheduler 6 resulting in sched 7 which can either "heal" lost
    workers periodically, or which is non-quiescent but which has all
    workers spin (maybe with some sleeping) until the finalize action
    is finished.

  * Remove lingering IORef usages and replace with HotVar type.

Tag functions:

 (*) Generate tag-function-correctess-enforcing code for all gets and puts. 

Traces: 
 (*) Currently the system reads traces but doesn't record them to disk
     (in compressed, binary format)

 (*) Ubigraph Trace visualization works but doesn't allow reversing
     time and controlling playback rate.
     (Many other feature enhancements here too.)

 (*) Synthesize .cnc spec from trace.  Fit (N-dimensional, linear) tag functions to traces.

Hierarchical Partitioning (Harch):

 (*) Generate code for each harch partition (which will at the very
     least order the collections and allow inlining a subgraph into one
     execute method).

Translation:

 (*) New API is supported, but advanced optimizations remain unimplemented.

   -- "Dense item collection" optimization is first on the list.  
      Step 1: allow user to manually say that an item collection is dense.
      Step 2: infer that downstream item collections are dense
              starting from dense ones + tag functions.


Even more experimental / future-workish:

 (*) Integrate wih Parallel Advisor, adapting it so that it can
     provide helpful feedback on single-assignment use of memory.



 (*) Fix lexSpan so that it gets the whole token not just its start.
